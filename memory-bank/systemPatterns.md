# Todo App System Patterns

## Architecture
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript for type safety
- Component-based architecture
- Custom hooks for state management

## Component Structure
- Presentational components in `components/ui/`
- Business logic in custom hooks
- Screen components in `app/(tabs)/`

## State Management
- Local state with useState
- Memoization with useCallback
- Future: AsyncStorage for persistence

## Type System
- Interface-based type definitions
- Shared types between components
- Strict TypeScript configuration

## UI/UX Patterns
- Material Design icons
- Consistent spacing and shadows
- Responsive layout
- Accessibility support

## Error Handling
- Type checking
- Input validation
- Future: Error boundaries

## Performance Considerations
- Memoized callbacks
- FlatList for efficient list rendering
- Minimal re-renders

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing Focus**
   - Critical business logic
   - Utility functions
   - State management
   - Data validation

2. **Manual Testing**
   - UI functionality
   - User interactions
   - Visual consistency
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Future Testing Considerations**
   - Selective integration tests for critical paths
   - UI automation for core workflows
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Accessibility testing
